  It’s really a question of focus. I’m more interested in UI and usability.

  In other words, it doesn’t matter how pretty or bug-free your code is on the inside when nobody can figure out how to use the outside.

  I do have a few high level coding books in here, but I explicitly avoid recommending anything too specific or overly technical. Most developers are pretty good at the technical coding stuff anyway; what they need is to exercise some different muscles.
